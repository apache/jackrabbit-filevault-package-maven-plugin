Validators
===================================================

Overview
--------
With the goals [`validate-package`](validate-package-mojo.html) and [`validate-files`](validate-files-mojo.html) it is possible to run validation on top of the given package or the package source files.
Validation itself is implemented with the [Jackrabbit FileVault Validation Framework][vlt.validation] which also contains a lot of standard validators.
Look there on which validators are contained and what options they provide.


Configuration
--------
It is possible to adjust every validator registered in the system (both default and external validators) with the parameter `validatorsSettings`. This is a map with the keys being the validator ids (and optionally suffixed by `:<package group>:<package name>` to restrict to only certain package ids) and the values being complex objects.
Here is an example configuration

```
<configuration>
  <validatorsSettings>
    <jackrabbit-filter>
      <isDisabled>false</isDisabled><!-- false is default, true disables the validator completely, all other setting are not relevant then -->
      <defaultSeverity>error</defaultSeverity><!-- lower case enum values of .. />
      <options>
        <severityForUncoveredAncestorNodes>error</severityForUncoveredAncestorNodes>
      </options>
    </jackrabbit-filter>
    <!-- later items potentially overwrite earlier items -->
    <jackrabbit-filter:mygroup:mypackage>
      <isDisabled>true</isDisabled><!-- disable the validator for a specific package -->
    </jackrabbit-filter>
  </validatorsSettings>
</configuration>
```

The options for the individual validators together with the validator ids are documented at [Jackrabbit FileVault Validation Framework][vlt.validation].

Severities
------
The validation message severities have an impact on the build outcome. By default every validation message with severity `error` will fail the build. One can adjust this setting by leveraging the configuration parameter `failOnValidationWarnings`.

Dependencies
------
All package dependencies are resolved via the [Maven Artifact Resolver][maven.resolver]. If package dependencies are only given via their package id a best guess resolution is tried by using the `name` as `artifactId` and `group` as `groupId`. You can tweak this fallback behaviour by leveraging the configuration parameter `mapPackageDependencyToMavenGa`.

Reference External Validators
-------
To reference an external validator it just needs to be given as [plugin dependency][maven.plugindependencies] to the `filevault-package-maven-plugin`.

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.jackrabbit</groupId>
  <artifactId>filevault-package-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- some validator extension -->
    <dependency>
      <artifactId>myartifact</artifactId>
      <groupId>mygroup</groupId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</plugin>
```
